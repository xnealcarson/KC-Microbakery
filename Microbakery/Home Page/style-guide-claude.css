1. Navigation:
- Sticky navigation bar with centered menu items
- Smooth hover effects
- Mobile-responsive menu that stacks on smaller screens
- Added Font Awesome for the search icon

2. Hero Section (section1):
- Centered layout with generous padding
- Large, eye-catching logo text
- Readable paragraph width
- Consistent typography hierarchy

3. Image Grid:
- Responsive grid layout that adjusts to screen size
- Subtle hover animation on images
- Consistent spacing and rounded corners
- Shadow effects for depth

4. Footer:
- Grid layout for address sections
- Improved readability with appropriate spacing
- Consistent link styling
- Mobile-responsive layout

5. Added Features:
- CSS reset for consistent rendering
- Responsive design with media queries
- Smooth transitions for interactive elements
- Better spacing and hierarchy
